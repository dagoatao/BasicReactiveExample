BasicReactiveExample
====================


Here I took a simple collectionview example I was able to find on the internet and added some reactive code. 
My idea here was a non complicated example of mixing Reactive Cocoa code with a UICollectionView. 

Some Reactive Concepts here include 
* observing value changes in objects 
* sending signals for control events 
* using RACDelegateProxy to bind to a uicollectionview delegate method.

Very simple example of reactive programming and a very simple collection view.
 
 1.) Displays a collection view with random colors.
 2.) Displays a UIAlertView when a message string is changed.
 3.) NSLogs a message when an item is added.
